- Research Question
    1. Openmax -> Bugfix (negative logits how to handle) remove alpha? not imagenet -> discussion -> alpha remove
    2. Clustering centers validation or learning set -> no clustering necessary -> do we need to cluster?
    3. Cluster yes/no -> only a single would be best case (how many clustering is necessary to improve the classification)
    4. (Optional) CFAR10 -> 32x32x3 -> images CFAR100 no overlap (clustering openmax, openmax, softmax) ResNet-18 # -> farbhistogram cluster\
       network, cfar100, and Y:

- Compare y_ic and P_c
- Change input of openmax_learninng -> training_data and validation_data
- Second Dec Week (Before weekend)

- Learn on clustering, use clustering again on validation features
- (2-v) v = 0.1 -> 1.9, v =1 -> 1 (only negative values)
